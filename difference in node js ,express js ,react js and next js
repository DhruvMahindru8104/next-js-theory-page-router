1- react js is a frontend library , if we want to integrate backend we need node js . and here comes express js which is made on node js . it provide more backend features .
2- next js is full stack framework made with react and node js.its frontend is based on react js and its backend is based on node js . 
it doesnt need express js as it has more different good backend features

-nodejs (ek aisa platform jise hum kisi bhi machine mein download kre to us machine mein javascript run ho skti hai chahe vo hmara computer ho ,mobile ho , laptop ho ya koi server jismein humne website host kri )
-express js (ek aisi library jo node js mein api bnane k kaam aati , vaise hum node js mein bhi api bna skte but express js fast api bna deti ) 
-next js (backend) yeh bhi node js k upr bna hai ismein hum sb features use kr skte like authentication , api bnana , server side rendering etc.
both are made on node js (ek aisa platform jo hmari javascript ko server pe run krta)


see in simple 
-before javascript was only run on browser , but then engineer decide to make a change , they made node js , means if we want to run javascript on any machine , node js should be installed on machine .
so that's how node js makes javascript a server side language . we download node js on the server where we hosted our website so that our website can interact with server through javascript . 
-and express js is a library made on node js . which make api routes and fetching data. 
-similarly next js backend is made on node js which can perform same task as express js but with more efficient way 


Simplified Summary:
JavaScript on Browsers: Initially, JavaScript could only run in the browser. Engineers wanted to enable JavaScript to run on servers as well, so they created Node.js.

Node.js: This allows JavaScript to be installed on any machine, making it possible to run JavaScript server-side. By installing Node.js on the server where a website is hosted
, developers can use JavaScript to interact with the server.

Express.js: This is a library built on Node.js that simplifies the creation of API routes and data fetching, making it easier to handle backend operations in JavaScript applications.

Next.js: Similar to Express.js, Next.js has its backend capabilities built on Node.js. It can perform tasks like creating API routes and data fetching but does so in a more efficient way, 
offering additional features such as server-side rendering and static site generation.
