2- next js is full stack framework made with react and node js. its backend is based on node js . 
it doesnt need express js as it has more different good backend features

-express js (backend) is used to integrate backend in reactjs websites
-next js (backend) is used to integrate backend in next js websites

Summary:
React.js:

Frontend Library: React.js is a frontend library used to build user interfaces. To integrate backend functionality, we use Node.js.
Express.js:
Built on Node.js, Express.js is used to provide more backend features, making it easier to handle routing, middleware, and API requests in React.js applications.
Next.js:

Full-Stack Framework: Next.js is a full-stack framework that combines React and Node.js. Its backend capabilities are built on Node.js.
No Need for Express.js: Next.js does not require Express.js because it includes built-in backend features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
Key Roles:

Express.js (Backend): Used to integrate backend functionality in React.js websites.
Next.js (Backend): Used to integrate backend functionality in Next.js websites.
Node.js: Both frameworks are built on Node.js, which is a platform that allows JavaScript to run on the server.
